A game created in Unity to support the Mobile Computing course exam.
The mobile game is inspired by the Kill Bill saga, whose objective is to hit the objects that appear on the game screen, wielding the protagonist's katana.
Using your reflexes and precision, you must hit the objects, accumulating as many points as possible in each game.
The smaller the object, the higher the score that is added, being careful not to hit the bomb otherwise you will return to the initial score, generating a new game.
